# Applied_Deep_Learning_Assignment3

Tech Stack used: Numpy, PyTorch, matplotlib, torchvision, TSNE, Neural Network

In this assignment, the goal was to implement and analyze feedforward neural networks for a classification task using PyTorch. The tasks include reproducing code from a class example for MNIST digit classification, implementing a two-layer fully connected neural network, and conducting training and evaluation procedures. The assignment also addresses mitigating pseudorandomness by ensuring consistent results across runs, exploring the impact of seed numbers on model robustness. Additionally, the dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets, and models are trained with a focus on minimizing validation error. A grid search is conducted to optimize hyperparameters, and the results are summarized in a table. Feature analysis involves using t-SNE to visualize hidden features and input images, with a discussion on the observed differences and their implications for the learned model. The final submission includes a well-organized PDF report and a compressed container containing the code, emphasizing clarity and conciseness throughout the presentation of results and analyses.
